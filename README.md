## The Philosophy

The name **YutoriAo** embodies a Japanese philosophy that defines the soul of
this project:

### Yutori (ゆとり)

In Japanese, _Yutori_ (ゆとり) signifies "spaciousness" or "room to breathe" -
a state of mental and temporal slack to navigate life with composure.
This image is stripped of digital noise, providing a desktop environment that
feels open, unhurried, and calm.

### Ao (青)

Representing "Blue" (青), this is a tribute to the [Universal Blue](https://github.com/ublue-os)
ecosystem, acknowledging its roots in the Fedora/CentOS community.
It inherits the reliability and modern container-native architecture of its
foundation.

> **YutoriAo** = "The Spacious Blue." A sanctuary in the cloud-native forest.
